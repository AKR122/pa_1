On average, the stressed /o/ seems to have longer duration and more
intensity and pitch. It’s possible that this is due to my pronunciation,
as I definitely didn’t speak naturally when recording because I wanted
to speak as clearly as possible and listening back to the recording I
can tell it sounds skewed. So perhaps with a more natural recording this
wouldn’t be as pronounced a difference?
