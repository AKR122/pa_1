``` {r}
"dur_hablo_stressed" <- 483
"dur_hablo_unstressed" <- 533
"dur_o_stressed" <- 190
"dur_o_unstressed" <- 220
"int_o_stressed" <- 64.212
"int_o_unstressed" <- 70.641
"f0_o_stressed" <- 145
"f0_o_unstressed" <- 162.138
```

``` {r}
dur_hablo_unstressed - dur_hablo_stressed

dur_o_unstressed - dur_o_stressed

int_o_unstressed - int_o_stressed

f0_o_unstressed - f0_o_stressed
```


On average, the stressed /o/ seems to have longer duration and more intensity and pitch. It's possible that this is due to my pronunciation, as I definitely didn't speak naturally when recording because I wanted to speak as clearly as possible and listening back to the recording I can tell it sounds skewed. So perhaps with a more natural recording this wouldn't be as pronounced a difference?
